# hello-world

Welcome to my Hello-World repo! This is where I'm learning the ropes of GitHub and doing some Python practice.

## About Me

Hey there! I'm a student who loves tech and design. I'm working through this GitHub tutorial to get better at it.

I've got a background in UX design and I'm good with numbers, too. I love making designs that everyone can use. As I learn GitHub, I'm excited to work on projects that make life easier and more fun for people.

## Why this repo?

This is my playground for learning GitHub. As I go through the GitHub tutorial, this is where you'll see what I'm learning and working on. So, expect some updates!

Thanks for checking this out!
